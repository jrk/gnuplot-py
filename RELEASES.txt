These are notes about the steps to make a new release of Gnuplot.py.

0. Get the current SVN version, and put it in a local directory called Gnuplot
   $ svn co --username=SFNAME https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk Gnuplot
   where SFNAME is your sourceforge username.

1. Edit the following files for the release:

   NEWS.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and make
       sure that the comments are up to date. 
       Remove the "Version ?.?:" line.

   ANNOUNCE.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and
       update the blurbs as appropriate.

   Gnuplot.html -- update the version number where it appears.  
       Update the "News" section.

   __init__.py -- increment the __version__ string. If there is a
       "+" on the end, remove it.

2. Check the changes into Subversion, with an appropriate comment
   $ svn commit  -m "Official version 1.8"

3. Tag the release in Subversion:
   $ svn cp https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk \
            https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/tags/release-1.8 -m "Adding tag for release 1.8."

4. Create new documentation using happydoc. cd to the Gnuplot directory, then
   $ rm -rf doc
   $ cd .. 
   $ happydoc -d Gnuplot/doc -t 'Gnuplot.py' Gnuplot
   Note:
   To install happydoc, you download its source from sourceforge,
   and unpack it, then 
     $ cp -r happydoclib/ /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
     $ cp happydoc /usr/local/bin
   
5. Generate the source distributions in Gnuplot/dist; cd to Gnuplot and then:
   $ python2 ./setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip

6. [OMIT THIS] Generate the binary distributions.  [I don't think a binary
   distribution is worthwhile because the place that the files need to
   be installed is dependent on the version of python being used.]
   $ python2 ./setup.py bdist --format=gztar,zip,rpm,wininst

7. Release the files on SourceForge:
   $ cd dist
   $ ftp upload.sourceforge.net   (username anonymous)
     cd incoming
     put gnuplot-py-1.8.tar.gz  
     put gnuplot-py-1.8.zip

   a. Log in to the sourceforge web interface, choose Gnuplot.py
      from "My projects"

   b. Select Admin -> "File release system"

   c. Click on "Add Release" for package Gnuplot-py.

   d. Type a release name of the form "1.8".

      Click on "Create This Release"
      
   e. In "Step 1: Edit Existing Release",
      check the "Preserve my pre-formatted text." button below the text boxes
      Paste the "New features in this version" section of ANNOUNCE.txt
      into the "Paste the notes in" text box.
      Paste the section of NEWS.txt for this release in to the 
      "Paste The Change Log In" text box
      Click "Submit/refresh"

   f. In "Step 2: Add Files To This Release" section,
      Select gnuplot-py-1.8.tar.gz  and gnuplot-py-1.8.zip in the 
      list of files, then click   "Add files or refresh view"

   g. In "Step 3: Edit Files In This Release", 
      For gnuplot-py-1.8.tar.gz, under "Processor" select
      "Platform-Independent" and under "file type" select "source .gz",
      then click "Update/refresh"
      For gnuplot-py-1.8.zip, under "Processor" select
      "Platform-Independent" and under "file type" select "source .zip".
      then click "Update/refresh"

   h. In "Step 4: Email release notice", check "I'm sure", then
      click "Send Notice".

8. Upload the new web page files (modified in step 1) to sourceforge:
   $ sftp SFNAME@shell.sf.net
     cd /home/groups/g/gn/gnuplot-py/htdocs
     put Gnuplot.html
     put ANNOUNCE.txt
     put NEWS.txt
     quit
   This updates the Gnuplot.html home page, http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/
     
9. Update the project news page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot-py/)
   - log in to sourceforge on the web
   - select Gnuplot.py from "My projects"
   - Admin -> News -> Submit
       Subject: Gnuplot.py version 1.8 released
       For the "Details" box, select some stuff from NEWS.txt, eg:
          ----
          Version 1.8 of Gnuplot.py has just been released.
          Highlights:
          + Compatible with NumPy
          + Compatible with future python where "with" will be a reserved word
          + Added a 'pdf' terminal definition 
          + hardcopy allows for terminal='svg'
          See NEWS.txt for more details.
          ----
      Then delete the News item for the previous release: return to
      Admin -> News, click on the item for the previous release,
      select "displayed", select "delete", and click "submit".

10. Send an announcement to gnuplot-py-users@lists.sourceforge.net

11. Send an announcement to comp.lang.python.

12. Append a '+' to the __version__ string in __init__.py to
    distinguish intermediate Subversion releases from official
    releases.  Add a "Version ?.?:" line to NEWS.txt to receive future
    change notes.  
    Check the changes into Subversion, with a suitable comment, eg:
    svn commit  -m "Version 1.8+"
