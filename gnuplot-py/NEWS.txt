This file describes the changes introduced in each version of the
Gnuplot.py package.


Version 1.3:

* Converted to package format.  The main file is now called
  __init__.py, so that it can be loaded by typing 'import Gnuplot'.

* Passing GridData a callable function was basically broken because of
  the kludgey way of overloading the argument.  Instead of trying to
  fix it, I moved that functionality to a new type of PlotItem
  called 'GridFunc'.

* Added a new keyword argument, 'ufunc', to grid_function and to
  GridFunc.  If that argument is nonzero, then the function is
  evaluated matrix-wise (in that case it must be composed only of
  ufunctions or ufunction-like routines).

* Fixed a 'typecode' problem with grid_function (typecode is
  apparently a positional, not a keyword, argument in the Numeric
  library).

* Separated the demonstration code into a separate file, demo.py, to
  shorten __init__.py a bit.


Version 1.2 (8 Aug 1999):

* Support for MS Windows, using the `pgnuplot.exe' program.
  Thanks go especially to Craig Schardt for help with this.

* Support for using binary files to send grid data to splot.
  This saves a lot of time and usually saves space compared with
  the old text files.  (Only works with recent versions of
  gnuplot.)

* Support for sending data to gnuplot as `inline data' (i.e., "plot
  '-'").  This method should be faster than the alternate method,
  temporary files.  (Only works with recent versions of gnuplot.)

* Allows PlotItem options to be modified after the PlotItem is
  constructed.

* Simplified the PlotItem inheritance hierarchy (Data and GridData are
  no longer derived from File).

* Added several configuration options (see top of Gnuplot.py).

* Separated function-based interface into a separate file
  (Gnuplot_plot.py).

* Added a test module, Gnuplot_test.py, which tests most of the
  features of Gnuplot.py.

* A README file, lots of documentation changes, etc.


Version 1.1a (9 Apr 1999):

This version just addresses a couple of minor portability issues.


Version 1.1 (31 Jan 1999):

* 3-D plots are now supported through the new 'splot' method:
  + To create a scatter plot, pass splot a 2-D array containing
    (x,y,z) triplets;
  + To create a grid plot, pass a 3-D array consisting of a 2-D array
    of (x,y,z) triplets; or
  + Use the new `GridData' PlotItem to plot gridded data (data
    tabulated on a rectangular grid).

* It is now easier to pass data to gnuplot.  The 'Data' PlotItem now
  accepts multiple arguments representing subsequent 'columns' of the
  dataset; e.g., what used to be written as

      g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
      x = Numeric.arange(100)/10.0
      y = x**2
      # Create an array of (x,y) pairs:
      g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(Numeric.transpose((x, y))))

  can now be shortened to

      # Plot y vs. x directly:
      g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(x, y))

  (both examples plot x squared vs. x).  Similarly, splot can be
  passed three arrays representing the values of x, y, and z.
  Note that the old interpretation is still used if a single
  argument is passed to `Data'.
