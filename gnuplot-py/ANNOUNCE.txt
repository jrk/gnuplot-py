This is to announce the release of version 1.6 of Gnuplot.py.

Gnuplot.py is a Python [1] package that allows you to create graphs
from within Python using the gnuplot [2] plotting program.

Gnuplot.py can be obtained from

    http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/

Prerequisites (see footnotes):
    the Python interpreter [1]
    the Python Numeric module [3]
    the gnuplot program [2]

Some ways this package can be used:

1. Interactive data processing: Use Python's excellent Numeric package
   to create and manipulate arrays of numbers, and use Gnuplot.py to
   visualize the results.
2. Web graphics: write CGI scripts in Python that use gnuplot to
   output plots in GIF format and return them to the client.
3. Glue for numerical applications (this is my favorite): wrap your
   C++/C/Fortran subroutines so that they are callable from Python,
   then you can perform numerical computations interactively from
   scripts or from the command line and use Gnuplot.py to plot the
   output on the fly.
4. Compute a series of datasets in Python and plot them one after the
   other using Gnuplot.py to produce a crude animation.

New features in this version:

  + Changed the hardcopy() method to be table driven so that other
    terminal types can be supported easily.  Currently includes
    definitions for 'postscript', 'png', 'fig', and 'cgm'.
  + Added gp_macosx.py to support Mac OS X.
  + Miscellaneous fixes suggested by users.  Changes for Mac OS
    suggested by Jon Moody.  Minor changes to work with Python 2.2.
  + Renamed "Exceptions" to "Errors" to be more consistent with other
    modules.  Moved them to a new Error.py module.

Features already present in older versions:

  +  Two and three-dimensional plots.
  +  Plot data from memory, from a file, or from an expression.
  +  Support for multiple simultaneous gnuplot sessions.
  +  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot program.
  +  Object oriented, extensible design with several built-in types
     of plot items.
  +  Portable and easy to install (nothing to compile except on
     Windows).
  +  Support for MS Windows, using the `pgnuplot.exe' program.
  +  Support for sending data to gnuplot as `inline' or `binary' data.
     These are optimizations that also remove the need for temporary
     files.  Temporary files are still the default.
  +  Partly table-driven to make it easy to extend.
  +  Support for distutils.

    scripting/rapid development language that is also especially good
    at gluing programs together.
[2] gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.org/> is a free, popular, very
    portable plotting program with a command-line interface.  It can
    make 2-d and 3-d plots and can output to myriad printers and
    graphics terminals.

    Python module that adds fast and convenient array manipulations to
    the Python language.
